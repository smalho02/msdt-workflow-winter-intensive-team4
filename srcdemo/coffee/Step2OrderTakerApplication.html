<h1>Step 2: Order Taker Application</h1>

<p> An application will always include the method <tt>__init__</tt> and at least one
method to define a form that the user of this application will use to complete a given task.
There could be several different forms for different tasks, but for this simple workflow there
is only one form and thus one method:  <tt>take_drink_order_form</tt> creator.
</p>

<h2>Modify the <tt>__init__</tt> method</h2>

<p>The <tt>__init__</tt> method is called automatically when we run the code in this file and 
consists of two lines of code, both of which you will need to edit.
        
<p>The first line of code tells WMP which workflow and role this application is associated with.
The second line of code tells WMP what kind of user interface is needed and where to
find the code to build that interface. We will edit each of these lines of code in turn:</p>

<h3>Editing the First Line of Code</h3>

<p>The first line of code actually calls an <tt>__init__</tt> method from another part of the WMP system,
which does the actual work of recording the workflow name and rolename for this application.  
To fix this line of code you need to replace <tt>"RoleName"</tt> with the actual
name you gave your workflow in <tt>CoffeeBackend</tt> and the actual name you gave the order taker
role (also in <tt>CoffeeBackend</tt>).  That way WMP knows where this application (user interface)
fits into the workflow you have defined.  See the <tt>__init__</tt> and <tt>wire</tt> methods in <tt>CoffeeBackend</tt>
for more explanation (and to remind yourself of the exact workflow name and role name you
have chosen).

<h3>Editing the Second Line of Code</h3>

<p>To fix the second line of code you need to replace <tt>"TaskName"</tt> with the actual name
you gave this task in <tt>CoffeeBackend</tt>.  Again, this is so WMP knows not only which workflow
and which role, but which task is associated with this application.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other important parts of this second line which
we have already taken care of, but which are worth taking note of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The method called in this line of code is <tt>register_source_step</tt>.  This is one of three
"flavors" of method which can be used when initializing a user interface.  A <i>source</i> step
is a user interface that is used to initiate a workflow.  For example, the first step
in the coffee workflow is taking the drink order.  A <i>sink</i> step refers to a step that is 
the last step in a workflow.  For example, in our simple workflow, preparing the drink
is actually the last step and so BaristaApplication will use <tt>register_sink_step</tt>.  When you get
the application running you will notice that the user interface for a sink step is actually
different than for a source step because it needs to show you a list of open orders.  That is why
a different method is used.  Finally, a <tt>transition</tt> step is an application that shows up
somewhere in the middle of a workflow.  (The coffee workflow is so simple that it has no
transition steps.)</li>

<li>The second parameter of <tt>register_source_step</tt> specifies which method contains the
code to build the user interface for this application.  In this case the method
is <tt>take_drink_order_form_creator</tt>, which, as its name suggests, handles the creation
of the drink order form (i.e. the user interface).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modify the <tt>take_drink_order_form_creator</tt> method</h2>

<p>The <tt>take_drink_order_form_creator</tt> method method does the actual work of building the user interface.
Unlike earlier labs where we use print and raw_input to communicate with the user,
here we are going to have a graphical user interface (GUI) which includes fields
the user can fill in, static text, and possibly other fancy things like buttons
and drop down lists.  WMP gives you a kind of "user interface language" which you
can use to tell it which of these elements to include in the user interface.</p>

<p>For now we will focus on just two of the user interface elements:  fields and static labels.  (the complete
set can be found in frontend/form.py and documentation and in the API documentation). All user interface elements are displayed on the form in the order in which they are added</p>

<p>The user interface itself is referred to as a form, a special object
created by WMP.  interface elements are added to a form by issuing commands
that look like this:</p>

<p><tt>form.add_static_label(parameters)
form.add_field(parameters)</tt></p>

<p>and so on</p>

<h3>Static Labels</h3>

<p>A "static label" element is any fixed text you may want to add to the form.  typically
this is used to add instructions to the user.  To add a static label, include a line of code that looks like this:</p>

<p><tt>form.add_static_label('text you want to include')</tt></p>

<p>For Lab 5:  a static label has been included below but the text is not very
relevant to the user.  Please modify the text to something more appropriate
to this application.  Feel free to add any additional static labels you think
are useful as you build this form.</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<p>A field is any kind of information you want to collect from the user, including
text, numbers, dates, and so on.  WMP takes care of adding the appropriate elements
to the user interface and handling user actions like clicking into and out of
various fields on the form.  The exact code to use for a field depends on the kind of field.  For example, to
add a field for a bit of text like a name (or a drink description) add the following:</p>

<p><tt>form.add_field(Type.SHORTSTRING, "FieldName")</tt></p>

<p><tt>Type.SHORTSTRING</tt> is used to specify that this is a text field (yes, there is a <tt>LONGSTRING</tt>
which we will get to in a moment).  The second parameter is the name WMP will use for this field.  
You should not use any spaces or special characters in this name.  For example, you might have a field
name like <tt>'FirstName'<tt>.</p>

<p>You can add several other kinds of fields by replacing SHORTSTRING with another field
type, although you are free to just use SHORTSTRING for this lab (others are listed below).</p>

<p>For Lab 5:  you need to add at least two fields to this form.  One should be to 
capture the customer's name.  The other should be to describe the drink which
the Barista needs to prepare.  These can both be of type <tt>SHORTSTRING</tt> as described
above.</p>

<p>Optionally you can add more fields and static labels and can even use different
types of fields (numbers, dates, etc.).  This additional information is described
below, but you do not need to read through it or add these additional features.</p>

<h3>Additional Fields and Options</h3>

<p>As noted above, adding additional types of fields or using these
other options is not required for Lab 5, but you are welcome to experiment.
Some additional options are available for all kinds of fields.  They are
illustrated in the following line of code:</p>

<p><tt>form.add_field(Type.SHORTSTRING, "FieldName", labeltext="Field Label", initial="default")</tt></p>

<p>You can specify a label to use on the form for any field.  If you omit this parameter
then the FieldName is used, but sometimes it is nice to have a more user friendly
label on the form itself.  For example, if the field name is <tt>"CustomerName"</tt> you might
want the label used to actually be "Customer Name" since that has a more familiar
look than two words with no space between them.</p>

<p>You can also specify an initial value to use for the field.  This default value
will be used if the user does not change it.  Other types of fields (besides text) can be 
added to a form by replacing <tt>SHORTSTRING</tt>
with one of the following:

<dl>
<dt><tt>INTEGER</tt></dt>
<dd>Will create a field that only allows integer values.</dd>

<dt><tt>CURRENCY</tt></dt>
<dd>Will create a field formatted for U.S. currency.  Internationalization is
on our to do list.</dd>

<dt><tt>DATE</tt></dt>
<dd>Will add a date field.</dd>

<dt><tt>BOOLEAN</tt></dt> 
<dd>Will add a yes/no checkbox.  (Why 'Boolean' you may ask?  In honor of
George Boole, a logician who made important contributions to logic and thus
computer science.  Logic as in TRUE v. FALSE or YES v. NO, just like our checkbox.)</dd>

<dt><tt>FLOAT</tt></dt> 
<dd>Will add a number that includes a decimal point (a "floating point"
number).  You can specify how many digits should be included after
the decimal point by including the digits parameter as follows:
<tt>form.add_field(Type.FLOAT, "FieldName", digits=4)</tt>
The default number of digits (if you omit the digits parameter) is 2.
Note also that the parameters with names (digits=, labeltext=, initial=) can be entered
in any combination and any order.</dd>

<dt><tt>LONGSTRING</tt></dt> 
<dd>Is for longer text fields.  The principle difference is that WMP will create
a multi-line text entry box for a LONGSTRING type field.</dd>

<dt><tt>CHOICE</tt></dt>
<dd>Will create a dropdown box listing a predefined set of options.  The options
need to be specified in an additional named parameter using the following format:
<tt>form.add_field(Type.CHOICE, "FieldName", choices=['first', 'second', 'third'])</tt>
You can have as few or many choices as you want as long as choices are in quotes
and separated by commas inside square brackets as in the above example.</dd>
