<h1>Step 1: Coffee Backend</h1>

<p>Our Simple Coffee Counter application has two roles: an OrderTaker and a Barista.  
There is also a backend processor which handles automated tasks and/or communication
amongst the frontend applications.</p>

<p>Your job will be to edit the files defining all three parts of the system in turn,
starting with the backend.  Here is what you need to do edit the backend:</p>

<h2> Make sure that you use only alphabetic characters in all your names!!!</h2>


<h2>Modify the <tt>wire</tt> method</h2>

<p>Look in the code for a method that starts:</p>
<p><tt>    def wire(self): </tt></p>

<p>The wire method is where we tell MWP which tasks to keep track of.
Wire does not take any parameters other than self, but you will need to 
add a line of code for each task in the process that MWP needs to keep
track of.</p>
        
<p>For Lab 5 there are two tasks we need to 'register':  taking an order
and preparing the drink.  To register a task, you will need to add a line of code that looks
like this:</p>
        
<p><tt>self.register_result_listener("RoleName", "TaskName", self.method_name)</tt></p>
        
<p>In this line of code: <tt>self.register_result_listener</tt> 
is the name of the function being called.
(The actual code for this can be found in a file called backend.py which
you don't need to change or even look at, since it is part of the MWP
system.  If you look above, you will see that this code is imported 
at the top of this file.)</p>
        
<p>The first parameter <tt>"RoleName"</tt> should be replaced with the name of the 
role (aka person aka job) that carries out this task.  For example, "Barista"
if this is a task that the Barista does.  the <tt>RoleName</tt> should be all letters
and numbers with NO SPACES.  So if the task were being carried out by a
computer programmer you would use a rolename like <tt>"ComputerProgrammer"</tt> (or <tt>"Programmer"</tt>).</p>
        
<p><tt>"TaskName"</tt> should be the name you give to this particular step in the process.
Again, this name should have no spaces in it.</p>
        
<p>Note that you are free to use whatever names you like for the role and the
task, but you need to be consistent throughout the MWP application.
In particular, when you define your user interface for a given task (e.g.
in <tt>BaristaApplication.py</tt> and <tt>OrderTakerApplication.py</tt>) you will need to 
register those tasks using the same role and task names you use here.</p>
        
<p>Finally, <tt>self.method_name</tt> should be the name of the method you will use (below)
to take action after this task has been carried out.  Typically the action
will be to assign the next task in the process.  Note that the method name
is prefixed by <tt>'self.'</tt>tt> and that there are no quotes around <tt>self.method_name</tt>.</p>
        
<p>For Lab 5 we have already set up the two methods you will need here:</p>
<ul>        
<li><tt>        self.drink_order_taken</tt></li>
<li><tt>        self.drink_prepared</tt></li>
</ul>
<p> so you will use one of these in each line of code. </p>

<h2>Modify the <tt>drink_order_taken</tt> method</h2>

<p>Look in the code for a method that starts:</p>
<p><tt>    def drink_order_taken(self, results): </tt></p>

<p>this method (i.e. function) gets called to update data and schedule any tasks
necessary after a drink order is taken.  Specifically, this function
will set the status to "complete" on the "take drink order" task
and assigns the preparation of this drink to the Barista.</p>
        
<p>You don't call this function yourself.  MWP will call the function
whenever there is a new row in the Google spreadsheet for a drink order.
you tell MWP to call this particular function for this particular
event by adding a line of code in the <tt>wire</tt> method above.</p>
        
<p>When drink_order_taken gets called, the results parameter will be
set by WPM to contain a list of "results" from any recent
drink orders that need to be dealt with.  Each result "object"
contains all the data associated with that particular drink order.</p>
        
<p>We already include the code to update the status
of the &quot;take drink order&quot; task.  We also include the line of code
which adds the new task to the workflow system.  What is NOT included
below is the code to create the new task to be added.  you need to 
add a line of code that looks like this:</p>

<p><tt>task = Task.construct_from_result(result, "RoleName", "TaskName")</tt></p>
        
<p>In this code, <tt>RoleName</tt> and <tt>TaskName</tt> have the same meaning as in the 
code you added to the <tt>wire()</tt> method above.

<h2>Modify the <tt>drink_prepared</tt> method</h2>

<p>Look in the code for a method that starts:</p>
<p><tt>    def drink_prepared(self, results): </tt></p>

<p>This method is similar to <tt>drink_order_taken</tt>, except that it is called
after the barista has prepared the drink.  in our very simple workflow
this is the last step in the process, which means that this method has
a very simple job:  it just needs to mark the status of the barista's
task (stored in the results variable) as Complete.  You do not need
to create a new task and you do not need to add a task to the workflow.</p>

<p>We have not included the code for this method below.  (Note the "pass" statement
below tells python to "pass" on doing anything at all in this method.</p>

<p>To complete the code for this method you will want to remove the pass
statement and replace it with some of the code from drink__order_taken.
Try copying all the code and deleting whatever you don't need here.</p>
